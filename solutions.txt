### Part 1: Test on basic docker commands

- Pull docker image `busybox`.

	docker pull busybox

- Run `busybox` such that there is a text "Hello world!" printed out on the terminal.

	docker run busybox echo "Hello world!"

- Use command to check all containers including exited ones.

	docker ps -a

- Run `busybox` in interative mode with bash shell.
	
	docker container run -i -t busybox sh

- Run `busybox` in detached mode and also make sure the container does not exit (Hint: you can use command `sleep infinity`).

	docker run -d busybox sleep infinity

- Stop and then remove all running container.

	docker ps -aq | xargs docker stop | xargs docker rm
	
- Check all available Docker images and then remove `busybox` image.

	docker image ls
	docker image rmi busybox

### Part 2: Test on basic docker compose
- Check version of your docker compose.
`	Command used: docker compose version
		Version: v2.6.0
		
		
- Write a `docker-compose.yaml` file with following requirements:
    * two services name `service-1` and `service-2`.
	* `service-1` will use image `busybox` and `service-2` will use image `hello-world`.
	* at least 1 folder in your PC will be mounted inside container of `service-1`.
	* `service-1` should print out `Here is busybox` if you don't run it in detached mode.
	

	
  version: '2.6.0'

  services:

    service-1:
      image: busybox
      volumes:
        - /home/anshulgupta/Desktop/training/Docker/Docker_tools
      command: echo 'Here is busy box'

    service-2:
      image: hello-world
	
	
- Use docker-compose to run the `docker-compose.yaml` file you have just written and then stop all services.
	sudo docker-compose up
	
- Use docker-compose to run the `docker-compose.yaml` file again in detached mode and then stop all services.

	sudo docker-compose up -d
